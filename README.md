tonome
======

Matrix-player style instrument. Transmits tone-matrix scale notes on four different panels using OSC (Open Sound Control)

This uses the following libraries:

osc-tools : https://github.com/alistairrutherford/osc-tools

netthreads-libgdx : https://github.com/alistairrutherford/netthreads-libgdx

It targets the desktop and Android. Still a work in progress.
